## MethylRec: Methylomes for Recombination Prediction

This is a Python3 implementation to predict recombination rates in plant species using the count of methylated cytosines per 100 kb as input features. It uses the "Extra Trees" machine learning model to develop the predictions. Data are provided for Arabidopsis, maize, sorghum and tomato. The model is trained with CG, CHG and CHH counts of all chromosomes. 

## Usage

Jupyter notebooks contain the code to train the model and make predictions.
